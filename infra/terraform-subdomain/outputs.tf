# Cover the four things a teammate acts on immediately after provisioning:
#   1. The Elastic IP (so the teammate adds the Route 53 A records)
#   2. The two Route 53 DNS records to create (single AWS CLI command)
#   3. SSH commands (once keys are valid)
#   4. The expected final public URL (once DNS is up and LE certs issued)

    Run this once on your laptop to set / refresh the two A records:

      aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id ${var.route53_zone_id} --change-batch '{
        "Changes":[

    Verify with:

      dig +short poolparty.${var.subdomain}.${var.base_domain}

    Both should return ${local.public_ip} (Route 53 propagation is near-instant).
