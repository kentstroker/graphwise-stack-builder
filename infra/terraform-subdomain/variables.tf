After the first successful apply, capture `terraform output -raw ami_id` and set this variable to the resulting `ami-...` ID, then re-run `terraform plan` -- you should see no changes. From then on the module ignores AWS AMI publishes entirely. To upgrade later, look up the desired AMI with `aws ec2 describe-images --owners amazon --filters 'Name=name,Values=al2023-ami-*-arm64'` and bump this value (will trigger a controlled replace; snapshot EBS first if you care).
