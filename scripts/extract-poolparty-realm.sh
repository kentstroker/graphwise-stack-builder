# The classic AL2023 gotcha: cloud-init runs `usermod -aG docker ec2-user`,
# but an SSH session opened BEFORE that ran has effective groups frozen at
# login time and can't talk to /var/run/docker.sock. Every `docker run`
# returns "permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon
# socket" until the operator either runs `exec newgrp docker` to promote
# the current shell into the group, or logs out and back in. This script
# previously failed deep inside the first `docker run` with a cryptic
# permission error; the preflight below short-circuits that with a clear
# message naming the fix.

ERROR: 'docker' not found on PATH.

This script runs `docker run` against the poolparty-keycloak image to
extract the realm JSON.

  AL2023:  sudo dnf install -y docker && sudo systemctl enable --now docker
  macOS:   install Docker Desktop or colima

Then re-run this script.

    # from the "not a group member at all" case so we recommend the right fix.

        cat >&2 <<EOF
ERROR: cannot reach the Docker daemon, but '$USER' IS a member of the
'docker' group per /etc/group.

This SSH session was spawned BEFORE the group membership took effect --
the cloud-init 'usermod -aG docker $USER' ran AFTER this shell already
existed, so the shell's effective groups don't include 'docker' and
talking to /var/run/docker.sock returns "permission denied."

Fix it with EITHER:

    exec newgrp docker          # promote this shell into the docker group,
                                # then re-run scripts/extract-poolparty-realm.sh

  -- OR --

    exit                        # log out
    ssh ...                     # log back in (new login picks up the group)

Verify with 'id -nG' before re-running; 'docker' must appear in the output.
EOF
        exit 1
    elif command -v sudo >/dev/null 2>&1 && sudo -n docker info >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        cat >&2 <<EOF
ERROR: cannot reach the Docker daemon as '$USER', but 'sudo docker' works.

'$USER' is not in the 'docker' group. Add yourself and re-login:

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    exit && ssh ...             # OR: exec newgrp docker

Verify with 'id -nG' before re-running; 'docker' must appear in the output.
EOF
        exit 1
    else
        cat >&2 <<EOF
ERROR: cannot reach the Docker daemon.

Check that the daemon is running:
    sudo systemctl status docker          # AL2023 / Linux
    open -a Docker                        # macOS Docker Desktop

If it is running, confirm your user can talk to it:
    docker info                           # should print server details

If the issue is group membership (most common on a fresh EC2 boot):
    id -nG                                # must include 'docker'
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER         # if not, add yourself
    exec newgrp docker                    # then refresh this shell

Re-run this script once 'docker info' succeeds without sudo.

# Substitute Ontotext's ${...} env-var placeholders with concrete values.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ontotext's realm export ships with placeholders like
# ${POOLPARTY_KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_CLIENTSECRET} that were meant to be expanded
# at Keycloak boot time. The operator-managed KeycloakRealmImport CR does
# NOT perform that substitution -- the literal placeholder strings end up
# stored as the password / client secret values in Keycloak, breaking
# every login attempt against Ontotext-baked credentials.
#
# Fix: rewrite the realm export at extract time so the values match what
# PoolParty's image actually sends.
#
# Image-version coupling: POOLPARTY_KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_CLIENTSECRET is read
# from the PoolParty container env. As of poolparty:10.x, the value is
# ohIP3x4XuoCsGDsGlZRvNvO5VN6veFb5. If a future image bumps it, update
# the value below by inspecting `kubectl exec ... env | grep CLIENTSECRET`
# on a running PoolParty pod.
#
# (The companion fix is the post-install authz-import Job in
# charts/keycloak-realms/templates/keycloak-authz-import-job.yaml --
# the operator's RealmImport CR drops the .clients[].authorizationSettings
# block; the Job re-imports it via the Keycloak admin REST API.)
